Spirit Drumbot 3000
--

This is basically a forked and revised version of a project done at University. It uses [Nanpy](https://github.com/nanpy/nanpy), which is a library/API for using Python to control an Arduino.

Spirit Drumbot is a machine whose main components are:
* wood
* an old lamp post
* drumsticks
* springs
* 2 small 12 volt drill motors
* some shoe strings 
* a couple electric solenoids
* an Arduino Uno board
* Relay Shield
* My son's tamborine
* a Djembe


The Flask-Arduino Drummer is a Flask app that provides an API and web interface to control the drum. The original project also used a Raspberry Pi and was known by it's project codename, Jazzberry Pi.

A video from that project can be seen on youtube
